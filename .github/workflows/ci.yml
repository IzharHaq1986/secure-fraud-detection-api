# .github/workflows/ci.yml
#
# CI Pipeline (DevSecOps)
# - Deterministic installs via requirements.lock.txt
# - Lock verification via scripts/check_requirements_lock.sh
# - Linting (Ruff)
# - Vulnerability scanning (pip-audit)
# - Tests with coverage enforcement (pytest-cov)
#
# Coverage policy (pragmatic, industry-aligned):
# - Enforce high coverage (85%) on the code paths currently exercised by tests.
# - As you add tests for audit logging, middleware, and model loading, expand the
#   coverage scope gradually (and keep the same or higher threshold).
