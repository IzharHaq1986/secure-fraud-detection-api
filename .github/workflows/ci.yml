# .github/workflows/ci.yml
#
# CI Pipeline (DevSecOps)
# - Deterministic installs via requirements.lock.txt
# - Lock verification via scripts/check_requirements_lock.sh
# - Linting (Ruff)
# - Vulnerability scanning (pip-audit)
# - Test execution (pytest)
#
# Important:
# - CI runners do NOT have your local .env file.
# - We provide API keys to tests via GitHub Actions Secrets:
#     - API_KEY_ADMIN
#     - API_KEY_SERVICE
