# .github/workflows/ci.yml
#
# CI Pipeline (DevSecOps)
# - Installs dependencies from a pinned lock file for reproducibility.
# - Verifies the lock file matches the installed environment.
# - Runs linting (Ruff), vulnerability scanning (pip-audit), and tests (pytest).
#
# Important:
# - We upgrade ONLY pip (not setuptools/wheel) to avoid altering the locked environment
#   and causing lock verification diffs in CI.
